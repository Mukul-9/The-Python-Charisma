# The-Python-Charisma
As Python is one of the fastest and largest growing coding languages and also the best language for beginners that would flourish in the near future, I'm here with this repository of mine, sharing each and every single code that I ever made on numerous platforms/IDEs.

You can find all my works of Python in this very repository.  
This includes:
    
    Projects made on Repl.it
    
    Visual Python codes on Trinket and CodeSkulptor.
    
    Daily progress of learning python for beginners as well as intermediate level on Jupyter Notebook.
    
    Notes and Solutions to important questions on Udemy.com (Course Name: Python For Beginners: Zero To Hero).


Experience is the best teacher guys!
Nothing is better than reading a book and understanding the whole concept behind each and every code.
This repository as I mentioned is the BEST alternative of a book that you might have come across in 2k19!


See my code, Learn, Apply it yourself, get stuck, come back, clear your doubts, code again, just Never Stop!
Let's Go!
