# The-Python-Charisma
You can find all my works of Python in this very repository.  
This includes:
    Projects made on Repl.it
    Visual Python codes on Trinket and CodeSkulptor.
    Daily progress of learning python for beginners as well as intermediate level on Jupyter Notebook.
    Solutions to questions on Udemy.com (Course Name: Python For Beginners: Zero To Hero).

This Python Repository is an absolute fun way of learning python.
You don't need to buy any course or even watch YouTube videos, just follow my regular uploads and code side by side.
